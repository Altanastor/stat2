	Learning Objectives
</h4>

- Understanding correlation features:
- __r__ is a pure number without units
- __r__ is not affected by interchanging the two variables
- __r__ is not affected by adding the same number to all the values
- __r__ is not affected by multiplying all the values of one variable by the same positive number
- __r__ can be misleading in the presence of outliers or non-linear association
- _Ecological Correlations_ (based on rates or averages) tend to overstate the strength of associations for individuals
- Correlation measures association, but association doesn't equal causation.
