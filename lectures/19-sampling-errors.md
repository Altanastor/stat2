	Learning Objectives
</h4>

- The percentage composition of the sample usually differs by some amount from the 
percentage composition of the population.
- For probability samples, the likely size of the chance error is given 
by the standard error.
- Formula to compute SE for percentage (drawing at random from a 0-1 box).
- When the sample is only a small part of the population, the number of individuals
in the population has almost no influence on the accuracy of the sample percentage.
- It is the absolute size of the sample which matters, not the size relative to the 
population.
- When drawing without replacement, to get the exact SE you have to multiply by the
__Correction Factor__
- When the number of tickets in the box is large relative to the number of draws,
the correction factor is nearly one.
