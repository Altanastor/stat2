	Learning Objectives
</h4>

- Understanding the concept of __inference__ from the sample to the population.
- When drawing at random from a box, the expected value for the average of the draws
equals the average of the box.
- The SE for the average of the box of the draws equals the SE for their sum,
divided by the number of draws.
- The average of the draws can be used to estimate the average of the box.
- The SE for the average tells you the likely size of the amount off.
- A _confidence interval_ for the average of the box can be found by going to the right
number of SEs either way from the average of the draws.
