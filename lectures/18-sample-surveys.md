- A _sample_ is part of a _population_
- A _parameter_ is a numerical facto about a population.
- Usually a parameter cannot be determined exactly, but can only be __estimated__
- A _statistic_ can be computed from a sample, and used to estimate a parameter.
- A statistic is what the researcher know. A parameter is what the researcher wants to know.
- When estimating a parameter, one major issue is accuracy: how close is the estimate close to be?
- Discussion of methods for choosing samples.
