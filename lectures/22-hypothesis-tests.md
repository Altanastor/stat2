	Learning Objectives
</h4>

- A _test of significance_ gets at the question of whether an observed difference
is real (alternative hypothesis) or just a chance variation (null hypothesis).
- A _test statistic_ measures the difference between the data and what is expected 
on the null hypothesis.
- The _z-test_ uses the statistic _z_ = (observed - expected) / SE.
- The _P-value_ is the chance of getting a test statistic as extreme as or more 
extreme than the observed one.
- The _P_ value is computed on the basis that the null hypothesis is right.
- _P_ does NOT give the chance of the null hypothesis being right.
- Small vlaues of _P_ are evidence against the null hypothesis.
