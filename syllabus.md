### Description

__Statistics 2__ is a course designed primarily as a basic introductory course for statistical thinking. It is not very mathematical. Neither linear algebra nor calculus is required, although some concepts seem more natural if you understand integration and differentiation. You do need to be comfortable with math at the level of high-school algebra (e.g., the equation of a straight line, plotting points, taking powers and roots, percentages). 

The middle of the course involves a fair amount of combinatorics—counting. The emphasis of the course is critical thinking about quantitative evidence. Topics include reasoning and fallacies, descriptive statistics, association, correlation, regression, elements of probability, set theory, chance variability, random variables, expectation, standard error, sampling, hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, experiments and observational studies, as well as common techniques of presenting data in misleading ways.


### Homework Assignments

- Weekly homework assignments are due as posted online.
- Assignments must be turned in during lab discussion.
- Don't wait until the last hour to do an assignment. Plan ahead and pace yourself.
- After the due date of each assignment, you will have access to the correct answers in bCourses.
- The homework assignments tend to be are substantially more difficult than the exams.
- No late assignments will be accepted, for any reason, including, but not limited to, theft, extraordinary circumnstances, and your pet's dietary idiosyncrasies.
- Instead of late HW, I will drop your lowest two HW scores.


### Grading Structure

- 10% attendance
- 10% pop quizzes (during lab discussions)
- 20% homework
- 30% midterm
- 30% final


### Advice for success

Try to solve all exercises in each chapter: Some show up on exams. Read all homework and exam questions carefully, and take them literally—don't try to second-guess what is meant. Attend lab discussions.


### <a name="email-policy"></a>Email Policy

- You should only use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if Office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- Email sent for any other reason will NOT be considered or acknowledge.
- Do NOT expect me to reply right away (I may not reply on time).
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- Our conversations should take place in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.


### Academic Honesty

Do your own work. Collaborating on homework is fine—but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating will not be tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the [Center for the Student Conduct](http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct).
